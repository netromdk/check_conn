# Check_conn

Get notified when your internet connection drops and when it comes back 
up. I use it where connection is poor.

# Installation

* Install `terminal-notifier` using homebrew `$ brew install terminal-notifier`
* Install requests `pip install requests`
* Clone this repo
* Execute the application `./check_conn&`

# Troubleshooting

* Make sure the correct Python binary is being used
* Ensure the script is executable `chmod u+x check_conn.py`
